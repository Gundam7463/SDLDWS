(chages will be made)

This projects is not ready but this is the official repository that will be updated 
frequently. Once this projects is ready it aims to developer and no-developer to create games
for fun, tests very fast and commercial projects using the source code. 
Only need to do is 'CTRL' + 'C' and 'CTRL' + 'V' and you will 
get an entire game to edit what you want.

Here you will not find binary files like: dll's, .so or lib headers or make files. The source code 
is very clean, what you need to compile is just choose your favorite IDE, copy the res and source 
directory, set the env to compile SDL and compile. In the future when the first release version 
was released i will put some pre-compile platforms links to download here.
